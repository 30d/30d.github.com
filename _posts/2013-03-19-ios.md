Learning to code is hard, even harder to learn alone, so join us this April on a 30-day iOS Challenge!

##Why 30 Day Challenge?

People often say, programming likes a skill set: when you learnt the knowledge, you own it forever. 
However programming actually is more like a habit. If you don't use it, you lose it! 

Give yourself a challenge for a minimum of 30 days to build your habit.

Did you ever want or plan to learn to code? If yes, this is the time to get start and build apps.

Learning to code is hard, even harder if you learn alone. So join us this April on a 30-day iOS Challenge!

##Why 30 Day Challenge?

__30 Day Challenge__ comes from a belief that, if you do something everyday for 30 days, it likely becomes a habit.

We believe that programming is also like a habit. _If you don't use it, you may lose it._ 

Let's try! Give yourself a challenge for a minimum of 30 days to build your habit of programming.

##30 Day iOS Challenge 

This program focuses on self-study groups, with SIX workshops that are conducted by "Professional Instructors".

We hope to create an environment where you don't need to study alone anymore. Students will join together into small groups. Everyone can see progress of each member in the group via __iOS Challenge app__. Each member will remind and encourage others to finish their challenge.

Start Day: 7 April to 7 May

Tutorials will be provided online. SIX offline dates are as follows:

  -  Monday: 8th, 15th, 22th, 29th April

  -  Wednesday: 10th, 17th April

__DEMO Day on Monday 8th May!!!__

Sessons to be held in Plugins@Blk71. Time 7pm to 9pm.

##Can everyone join the iOS Challenge?
This course doesn't require you to have a programming background. The main requirement is you really need a huge passion to create things, and to be a builder.

You will need a Macbook to code and an iPhone (or iPod, iPad), this should be no problem for you :)

We may only choose 20 students for April class.

##One more thing!
When attending, you need to put in S$50. We give you back all, if you can finish your 30 Day Challenge!
